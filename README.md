"# imagesharingapp" 

This project is an attempt at trying to solve the problems laid out in the python test document, in order to run the code do the following:

* clone the git repository

* navigate to the folder where the files are located

* run the following command: py manage.py runserver

* navigate to localhost:8000/register in a web browser. This will allow you to register an account

After registering, the page should automatically redirect you to the posts page, here you can see everyones photos, there is also a button to go to your photos, there will not be any in there unless you add some using the django admin api. The photo's are all ordered by likes.

at the top of the page a search bar can be seen, this does not in fact search for anything, however, by pressing the return key as if searching for something, all of the registered usernames will be returned.
